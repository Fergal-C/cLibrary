-	Delete the .exe file in command line
-	Give the .exe file a specific name in command line


// CHARS & INTS
-------------------------------
-	Print size of int and long
-	Declare an unsigned int
-	Read in int and print its value
-	Use format specifiers to print decimal, hex and octal values of an int, a hex and an octal
-	Read in char, print its int value and vice versa
-	Read in char, determine if upper or lower and change case
-	Cast an int to a float
-	Print return value of printf()
-	Print return value of scanf()


// IF ELSE, TERNARY, SWITCH
-------------------------------
-	Read 3 ints, print max
-	Find max of 3 ints using ternary operator
-	Read in a year, print whether it is a leap year or not
		// every 4th year is a leap year
		// unless it is 100th year, but every 400th year is a leap year
-	The above Leap Year program using ternary operator
-	Use switch to print Zero, One or Invalid

// LOOPS
-------------------------------
-	Print sum of first n ints, using while and for loops
-	Read in ints from user, terminate if int is negative, print sum of all ints
-	Keep asking for user's age until they want to quit or until they are > 18


// RANDOM & ARRAYS
-------------------------------
-	Print seconds since Epoch
-	Create an array of random ints < 8, with number of elements given by user


// STRINGS
-------------------------------

-	Write code to find the length of a user inputted string
-	Count alpha chars and spaces in a string
-	Compare 2 strings
-	Find the longest word in a string
-	Check if a string is a plaindrome, ignore spaces and make case insensitive
-	Count Frequency of Digits in a String


// FUNCTIONS
-------------------------------
-	Write a function to test whether or not a passed in number is prime
-	Write a function, which uses the function above, to sum all the prime numbers less than a given value
-	Write a function to change case
-	Write a function to count number of digits in a number
-	Write function to test if a number is an Armstrong number, i.e. each digit raised to the power of the number of digits = the number itself
